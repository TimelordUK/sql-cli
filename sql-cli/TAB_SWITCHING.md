# Tab Key Mode Switching

## Overview
Tab key now provides natural switching between Command and Results modes, making navigation more intuitive.

## How It Works

### In Results Mode
- **Tab** → Switch to Command mode (focus SQL input)
- **Arrows/hjkl** → Navigate data (stay in Results)
- **Esc** → Also switches to Command mode (preserved for compatibility)
- **q** → Quit application

### In Command Mode  
- **Tab** → Switch to Results mode (if results exist)
- **Enter** → Execute query
- **Arrows** → Navigate command history
- **Text input** → Type SQL queries

## Benefits

1. **Natural Navigation**: Similar to standard SQL tools (pgAdmin, DBeaver)
2. **No Confusion**: Arrow keys always navigate within current mode
3. **No Accidental Switches**: No boundary-triggered mode changes
4. **Predictable**: Tab always toggles between the two main modes

## Testing

```bash
# Quick test
./test_tab_switch.sh

# Or manually
echo "id,name\n1,Alice\n2,Bob" > test.csv
./target/debug/sql-cli test.csv -e "select * from data"
# Press Tab to switch modes
```

## Implementation

- Added Tab mapping in `KeyMapper` for both modes
- `SwitchMode` action handles the mode transition
- Validates that results exist before switching to Results mode
- Shows helpful status messages on mode switch

## User Experience

Before:
- Had to use Esc to go from Results to Command
- Arrow keys at boundaries could be confusing
- Less intuitive for SQL tool users

After:
- Tab naturally toggles between modes
- Arrow keys always do what you expect
- Familiar to users of other SQL tools
