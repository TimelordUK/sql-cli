# Merge Summary - v10 Refactor Branch

## Completed Work

### 1. Fixed Shift-G Navigation Regression ✅
- **Issue**: Shift-G (goto last row) wasn't working in results view
- **Root Cause**: KeyBinding was checking for `KeyCode::Char('G')` without shift modifier
- **Fix**: Changed to `KeyBinding::with_shift(KeyCode::Char('G'))` in `key_dispatcher.rs`
- **Additional Fix**: Skip chord handler for 'G' key to prevent interference
- **Status**: Tested and confirmed working

### 2. Implemented History Protection System ✅
- **Issue**: History data occasionally gets cleared/lost mysteriously
- **Solution**: Created `history_protection.rs` module with:
  - Automatic backups before significant changes
  - Validation rules to prevent suspicious writes
  - Recovery mechanism from backups
  - Protection against empty arrays and massive data loss
- **Testing**: Unit tests pass, integration test confirms protection works
- **Key Features**:
  - Never writes empty history when entries existed
  - Blocks shrinking by more than 50%
  - Creates timestamped backups (keeps last 10)
  - Logs warnings: `[HISTORY WARNING]` and `[HISTORY PROTECTION]`

### 3. Started Widget Extraction Pattern ✅
- **Created**: `HistoryWidget` as first extracted widget
- **Documentation**: 
  - `docs/WIDGET_EXTRACTION_PATTERN.md` - Pattern guide
  - `docs/V10_REFACTOR_STRATEGY.md` - Overall strategy
  - `docs/STATE_MANAGER_INTEGRATION.md` - State management guide
- **Status**: HistoryWidget created but not fully integrated into enhanced_tui yet

### 4. Fixed Release Notes Generation Script ✅
- **Issue**: GitHub Action failing when generating release notes
- **Fix**: Created `generate_release_notes.sh` with proper error handling
- **Improvements**:
  - Handles empty grep results gracefully
  - Uses HEAD instead of HEAD^ for commits
  - Adds dynamic highlights based on changes
  - Fallback content when no categorized commits
