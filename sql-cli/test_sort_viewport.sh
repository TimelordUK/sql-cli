echo "=== Key Behavioral Points ==="
echo "‚úÖ None state: Clears sort indicators but keeps current data (NO query re-execution)"
echo "‚úÖ Ascending/Descending state: Calls sort_results_data() to get sorted data"
echo "‚úÖ Sort state properly advances via get_next_sort_order()"
echo "‚úÖ AppStateContainer handles all sort state management"

echo
echo "=== Viewport Reset Analysis ==="
echo "‚ùå OLD behavior (fixed): None state would call execute_query(), resetting viewport"  
echo "‚úÖ NEW behavior (current): None state just clears indicators, preserves viewport"
echo "‚úÖ Sort indicators should show ‚Üë ‚Üì for active sorts"
echo "‚úÖ No more double-handling of sort actions"

echo
echo "=== Manual Testing Instructions ==="
echo "1. Load CSV file with ./target/release/sql-cli test_sort.csv"
echo "2. Press 's' on Name column - should sort ascending (‚Üë)"
echo "3. Press 's' again - should sort descending (‚Üì)" 
echo "4. Press 's' third time - should clear sort (no indicators, same data)"
echo "5. Press 's' fourth time - should sort ascending again"
echo "6. Use F5 to debug dump and verify SortState in AppStateContainer"
