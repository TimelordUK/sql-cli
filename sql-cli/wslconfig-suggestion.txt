memory=32GB      # Half your RAM for WSL2 (leaves 32GB for Windows/RustRover)
processors=12    # Adjust based on your CPU core count
swap=16GB        # Generous swap space
localhostForwarding=true

# Optional performance tweaks
pageReporting=false    # Can improve performance
guiApplications=true   # If you use GUI apps
nestedVirtualization=true  # For Docker in WSL2
vmIdleTimeout=60000    # Keep VM warm for 60 seconds

# After saving, restart WSL2:
# 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
# 2. Run: wsl --shutdown
# 3. Wait 5 seconds
# 4. Start WSL2 again

# With this config:
# - WSL2 gets 32GB RAM (plenty for Docker + development)
# - RustRover can use -Xmx16384m (16GB) comfortably
# - Still leaves ~16GB for Windows and other apps
