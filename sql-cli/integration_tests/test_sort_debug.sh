echo "Run this command and follow these steps:"
echo "./target/release/sql-cli test_sort.csv"
echo
echo "Steps to reproduce the issue:"
echo "1. Press 's' on Name column - should sort ascending (â†‘)"
echo "2. Press 'F5' to see debug dump - check SORT STATE section"
echo "3. Press 's' again on Name column - should sort descending (â†“)"
echo "4. Press 'F5' again - check if SORT STATE updated"
echo "5. Press 's' third time - should clear sort (None)"
echo "6. Check if SORT STATE shows 'No sorting applied'"
echo
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- F5 debug should show AppStateContainer SORT STATE matching visual indicators"
echo "- Each 's' press should advance: None â†’ Ascending â†’ Descending â†’ None"
echo "- Sort indicators (â†‘ â†“) should appear in column headers when active"
echo "- 'No sorting applied' should only appear when sort is None"
echo
echo "If the issue persists, the problem is likely:"
echo "1. advance_sort_state() not properly updating AppStateContainer"
echo "2. TUI buffer not synchronizing with AppStateContainer state"
echo "3. sort state display logic showing wrong information"
