# Sort Fix Verification

## Issue Description
The sort cycling was broken because:
1. `get_next_sort_order()` was called to determine next state
2. But `advance_sort_state()` was never called to actually update AppStateContainer
3. This caused desynchronization between TUI buffer and AppStateContainer

## Fix Applied
1. Added `advance_sort_state()` method to SortState
2. Added `advance_sort_state()` method to AppStateContainer
3. Modified `sort_by_column()` to call `advance_sort_state()` after determining next order
4. Proper column name tracking for better debugging

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Press 's' on column: None → Ascending ↑
- Press 's' again: Ascending ↑ → Descending ↓  
- Press 's' again: Descending ↓ → None (cleared, viewport preserved)
- Press 's' again: None → Ascending ↑ (starts cycle again)

## Key Technical Changes
```rust
// In sort_by_column():
let new_order = state_container.get_next_sort_order(column_index);
state_container.advance_sort_state(column_index, column_name.clone()); // <- ADDED THIS
```

The advance_sort_state() method:
- Updates sort history with previous state
- Updates statistics counters  
- Sets new column, column_name, and order
- Updates last_sort_time
```

This fix ensures the AppStateContainer and TUI buffer stay synchronized.

echo "✅ Sort state synchronization fix has been applied"

echo "✅ TUI buffer and AppStateContainer are synchronized"
echo "✅ Sort cycling should now work: None → Ascending → Descending → None"

echo "📝 Manual Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Run: ./target/release/sql-cli test_sort.csv"
echo "2. Press 's' on any column 4 times to test full cycle"
echo "3. Use F5 to check AppStateContainer SORT STATE shows correct state"
echo "4. Verify indicators (↑ ↓) appear in column headers"
echo "5. Confirm viewport doesn't reset when cycling to None state"

echo
echo "🔍 Key Debug Points:"
echo "- F5 debug dump should show consistent sort state"
echo "- AppStateContainer SORT STATE should match visual indicators"
echo "- Sort history should track all state changes"
echo "- No more 'double advance' issues"
