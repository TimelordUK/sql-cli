# CommandEditor Migration Status

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete âœ…

We've successfully migrated core text editing to CommandEditor while keeping the old code as a safety net.

## What's Working Now

### In CommandEditor (New Implementation)
âœ… **Basic text input** - All characters, spaces, etc.
âœ… **Text navigation** - Arrows, Home/End, Ctrl+A/E  
âœ… **Word operations** - Ctrl+W, Alt+B/F/D, Ctrl+Left/Right
âœ… **Line operations** - Ctrl+K/U (kill line)
âœ… **Proper state sync** - Updates buffer correctly
âœ… **Special key filtering** - Ctrl+X and other app commands pass through

### Still in Old Methods (Working Fallback)
The old `try_handle_text_editing` and related methods are still present and handle:
- Clipboard operations (Ctrl+Y/V)
- SQL token navigation (Alt+[/])  
- History navigation (Ctrl+P/N/R)
- Some duplicate text operations (as fallback)

## Why Keep Both?

1. **Safety**: If CommandEditor misses something, old code catches it
2. **Gradual migration**: Can test thoroughly before removing old code
3. **Complex features**: History, clipboard, SQL navigation need careful migration
4. **No performance impact**: CommandEditor handles keys first, old code only runs for unmapped keys

## Migration Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Text Editing (COMPLETE)
- Basic input
- Navigation
- Word/line operations
- State synchronization

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: History Navigation (TODO)
- Ctrl+P/N - Previous/next command
- Ctrl+R - History search
- Alt+Up/Down - Alternative navigation
- History state management

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Clipboard & Kill Ring (TODO)
- Ctrl+Y - Yank from kill ring
- Ctrl+V - System clipboard paste
- Kill ring storage and management
- Clipboard integration

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: SQL-Specific Features (TODO)
- Alt+[/] - SQL token navigation
- Token parsing and awareness
- SQL context handling

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Cleanup (TODO)
- Remove duplicate handlers from old methods
- Consolidate remaining app-specific commands
- Update tests
- Documentation

## Current Code Organization

```

â”œâ”€â”€ CommandEditor (Phase 1) âœ…
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Character input
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Text navigation  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Word operations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Line operations

â”œâ”€â”€ try_action_system() 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Handles Ctrl+X, other app commands

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Ctrl+R
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Alt+Up/Down
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ try_handle_text_editing() (Has duplicates)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Clipboard ops (Phase 3)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SQL token nav (Phase 4)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [Duplicate text ops - will remove]
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ try_handle_mode_transitions()
    â””â”€â”€ Enter, Escape, etc.
```

## Testing Checklist

Before removing old code, verify:
- [ ] All text editing works in CommandEditor
- [ ] History navigation works
- [ ] Clipboard operations work
- [ ] SQL token jumps work
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

## Recommendation

**Keep the old code for now.** It's not hurting anything and provides:
1. A safety net for missed edge cases
2. A reference for implementing remaining features
3. Working implementations of complex features (history, clipboard)

Once all phases are complete and thoroughly tested, we can remove the old implementations in one clean sweep.
