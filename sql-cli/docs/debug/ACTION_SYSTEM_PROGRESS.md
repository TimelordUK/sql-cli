# Action System Integration Progress

## Phase 2 Completed: Navigation Key Extraction ✓

### What We've Done

1. **Integrated Action System into TUI**
   - Added `KeyMapper` instance to `EnhancedTuiApp`
   - Created `build_action_context()` to gather current state
   - Created `try_handle_action()` to process actions
   - Added integration point in `handle_results_input()` that tries action system first

2. **Extracted Navigation Actions**
   - Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
   - Vim navigation (h, j, k, l)
   - Page navigation (PageUp, PageDown)
   - Jump navigation (Home, End, first/last column)
   - Vim-style counts (e.g., 5j moves down 5 rows)

3. **Extracted Mode & UI Actions**
   - Toggle selection mode (v key)
   - Show help (F1)
   - Show debug info (F5)
   - Quit (q)
   - Force quit (Ctrl+C)

4. **Extracted Data Operations**
   - Toggle column pin (p)
   - Sort by current column (s)
   - Exit current mode (Esc)

### How It Works

1. When a key is pressed in Results mode:
   - First tries to map through `KeyMapper` to get an `Action`
   - If mapped, tries to handle through `try_handle_action()`
   - If handled, returns immediately
   - If not handled, falls back to legacy key handling

2. The `KeyMapper`:
   - Maps keys to actions based on current mode
   - Supports vim-style count prefixes (5j, 10k, etc.)
   - Has global mappings (F1, F5, Ctrl+C) that work in any mode
   - Has mode-specific mappings (navigation in Results mode)

3. The action handler:
   - Takes an `Action` enum value
   - Executes the appropriate TUI method
   - Returns `ActionResult` to indicate success/failure

### Benefits So Far

1. **Cleaner separation** - Key mapping logic separated from action execution
2. **Vim-style counts** - Now support 5j, 10k, etc. for efficient navigation
3. **Testable** - Actions can be tested independently of key handling
4. **Customizable** - Key mappings can be easily changed in one place
5. **Non-breaking** - All existing functionality preserved through fallback

### Next Steps

1. **Remove duplicate handling** - Navigation keys are now handled twice (action system + legacy)
2. **Extract more actions**:
   - Editing keys (text input, backspace, etc.)
   - Clipboard operations (yank, paste)
   - Search/filter operations
   - Command mode keys
3. **Move to reducer pattern** - Convert action handlers to pure functions
4. **Add key customization** - Load custom key mappings from config

### Testing

To verify the action system is working:

```bash
# Build and run with a test file
cargo build
echo "a,b\n1,2\n3,4" > test.csv
./target/debug/sql-cli test.csv -e "select * from data"

# Try these keys - status bar will show "✓ Action system handled: <key>"
# j, k, h, l - navigation
# 5j - move down 5 rows
# v - toggle selection mode
# p - pin column
# s - sort
# F1 - help
# q - quit
```

### Files Modified

- `src/ui/enhanced_tui.rs` - Added integration point and action handler
- `src/ui/actions.rs` - Action enum and types (already existed)
- `src/ui/key_mapper.rs` - Key to action mapping (already existed)

### Metrics

- **Keys extracted**: ~20 key combinations
- **Lines of legacy code that can be removed**: ~200-300 (not removed yet)
- **New code added**: ~100 lines (integration points)
- **Behavior changes**: None - 100% backward compatible
