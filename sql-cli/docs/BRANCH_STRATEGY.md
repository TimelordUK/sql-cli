# Branch Strategy

## Current Branch: `tui_function_decomposition_v1`

### Completed Work (Ready to Merge)
✅ **Phase 2 TUI Function Decomposition**
- `render_status_line`: 534 → 20 lines (96% reduction)
- `handle_command_input`: 416 → 130 lines (69% reduction)  
- `handle_results_input`: Refactored with orchestration pattern
- `run_app`: 195 → 10 lines (95% reduction)
- All functions now use clean `try_handle_*` dispatching pattern

✅ **Documentation & Analysis**
- Comprehensive state analysis (57 set_mode calls found)
- State transition mapping
- Parallel state manager design

### Status
This branch has **valuable refactoring work** that should be merged to main. The function decomposition significantly improves code maintainability.

## Next Work: Shadow State Manager

### Option 1: Continue on This Branch
- ❌ Risk mixing concerns (refactoring vs state management)
- ❌ Harder to revert if state work has issues
- ❌ Delays merging good refactoring work

### Option 2: Merge and Start Fresh Branch (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Merge current branch to main**
   - Get the refactoring improvements into production
   - Establish new baseline with cleaner code

2. **Create new branch: `shadow_state_v1`**
   - Start fresh for state management work
   - Can be feature-flagged and experimental
   - Easy to abandon if approach doesn't work

3. **Benefits**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Refactoring work gets used immediately
   - State work can be experimental without affecting stable code

## Recommended Actions

```bash
# 1. Push current branch
git push origin tui_function_decomposition_v1

# 2. Create PR for current work
# Title: "feat: Phase 2 TUI function decomposition with orchestration pattern"
# Description: Highlight the code reduction and improved architecture

# 3. After merge, create new branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main  
git checkout -b shadow_state_v1

# 4. Start shadow state implementation
# - Add shadow_state.rs module
# - Add feature flag in Cargo.toml
# - Add first observation point
```

## Why This Strategy Works

1. **Get Value Now**: The refactoring work is complete and valuable - ship it!
2. **Clean History**: Each branch has clear purpose
3. **Safe Experimentation**: Shadow state can be experimental on new branch
4. **Easy Rollback**: If state work fails, we still have the refactoring

## Commit Message for PR

feat: Phase 2 TUI function decomposition with orchestration pattern

Major refactoring achievements:
- render_status_line: 534 → 20 lines (96% reduction)  
- handle_command_input: 416 → 130 lines (69% reduction)
- handle_results_input: Orchestration pattern applied
- run_app: 195 → 10 lines (95% reduction)

All major TUI functions now follow clean orchestration pattern with
focused sub-functions handling specific responsibilities.

Also includes comprehensive state management analysis and design docs
preparing for future shadow state implementation.
