# Ctrl+X Expand Asterisk Fix

## The Problem
After implementing CommandEditor, Ctrl+X stopped working for expanding asterisks (*) to column names in SQL queries.

## Root Cause
CommandEditor was intercepting ALL character keys (including those with Ctrl modifiers) before they could reach the action system that handles special commands like expand_asterisk.

## The Fix
Added a filter to exclude special Ctrl/Alt combinations from CommandEditor processing:

```rust
// Check for special Ctrl/Alt combinations that should NOT go to CommandEditor
let is_special_combo = if let KeyCode::Char(c) = normalized_key.code {
    // Special Ctrl combinations
    (normalized_key.modifiers.contains(KeyModifiers::CONTROL) && matches!(c,
        'x' | 'X' | // Expand asterisk
        'p' | 'P' | // Previous history  
        'n' | 'N' | // Next history
        'r' | 'R' | // History search
        'j' | 'J' | // Export JSON
        'o' | 'O' | // Open buffer
        'b' | 'B' | // Buffer operations
        'l' | 'L'   // Clear screen
    )) ||
    // Special Alt combinations that aren't word navigation
    (normalized_key.modifiers.contains(KeyModifiers::ALT) && matches!(c,
        'x' | 'X'   // Expand asterisk visible only
    ))
} else {
    false
};

let should_try_command_editor = !is_special_combo && matches!(
    normalized_key.code,
    KeyCode::Char(_) | KeyCode::Backspace | ...
);
```

## What Now Works

### CommandEditor handles:
- Regular character input (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, spaces, etc.)
- Text editing with Ctrl (Ctrl+A/E, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+K/U)
- Word navigation with Alt (Alt+B/F, Alt+D)
- Basic navigation (arrows, Home/End)

### Action system handles:
- **Ctrl+X**: Expand * to all column names
- **Alt+X**: Expand * to visible column names only
- **Ctrl+P/N**: History navigation
- **Ctrl+R**: History search
- **Ctrl+J**: Export to JSON
- **Ctrl+O**: Open buffer
- **Ctrl+B**: Buffer operations
- **Ctrl+L**: Clear screen

## Testing
1. Enter Command mode (press 'a')
2. Type: `SELECT * FROM table`
3. Position cursor after the asterisk
4. Press Ctrl+X
5. The asterisk should expand to list all column names

## Key Learning
When implementing a text editor component that intercepts keyboard input, it's crucial to:
1. Identify which keys should be handled by the editor
2. Identify which keys have special application-level functions
3. Create a proper filter to route keys to the correct handler
4. Test all existing keyboard shortcuts after implementation
