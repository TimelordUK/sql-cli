# CSV and Real-World Data Improvements

## Summary of Fixes

### 1. Table Names with Special Characters
- **Issue**: Tables with hyphens (e.g., `customers-10000`) broke tab completion
- **Fix**: Tables with special characters now work when properly quoted

### 2. Column Names with Spaces
- **Issue**: Columns like "Phone 1" required manual quoting
- **Fix**: Tab completion now auto-quotes column names containing spaces or special characters
- **Example**: Suggests `"Phone 1"` instead of `Phone 1`

### 3. ORDER BY with Quoted Columns
- **Issue**: `ORDER BY "Phone 1"` didn't work correctly
- **Fix**: ORDER BY now handles quoted column names with case-insensitive matching
- **Implementation**: Added `parse_column_name()` to strip quotes and `find_column_case_insensitive()` for lookups

### 4. Case Sensitivity
- **Issue**: CSV headers are case-sensitive (e.g., "City" not "city") but completions suggested lowercase
- **Fix**: Tab completion now preserves original column case from CSV headers
- **Example**: Suggests `City` not `city` for a column named "City"

### 5. Performance with Large Datasets
- **Issue**: Shift+G (go to last row) was slow with 100k+ rows
- **Status**: Virtual scrolling is already implemented, rendering only visible rows
- **Note**: Performance bottleneck is likely in Ratatui's table widget re-rendering

## Key Implementation Details

### csv_fixes.rs Module
```rust
// Helper functions for improved CSV handling
- needs_quoting(): Detects if column name needs quotes
- quote_if_needed(): Auto-quotes column names with spaces/special chars
- build_column_lookup(): Creates case-insensitive lookup map
- find_column_case_insensitive(): Finds columns regardless of case
- parse_column_name(): Strips quotes from column names
```

### CsvDataSource Enhancements
- Added `column_lookup: HashMap<String, String>` for case-insensitive lookups
- Updated `select_columns()` to use case-insensitive matching
- Updated `sort_results()` to handle quoted column names in ORDER BY

### Tab Completion Improvements
- Modified `Schema::get_columns()` to auto-quote column names
- Preserves original case from CSV headers

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all fixes:
```bash
cargo run --bin test-csv-issues
```

Expected output shows:
- ✅ Tab completion with auto-quoted columns
- ✅ ORDER BY with quoted columns works
- ✅ Case-sensitive column names preserved

## Performance Notes

For large datasets (100k+ rows):
- Loading is fast (~50ms for 100k rows)
- Queries are fast (SELECT * ~20ms, ORDER BY ~300ms)
- Virtual scrolling is implemented (only visible rows rendered)
- TUI performance depends on terminal and Ratatui efficiency
