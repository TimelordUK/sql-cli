# Column Search Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Key Handler Issue
**Problem**: Column search was being triggered twice because the backslash key `\` had two handlers:
- Dispatcher action "start_column_search" 
- Direct key handler for `KeyCode::Char('\\')`

**Solution**: Removed all duplicate key handlers for search modes (/, \, F, f)

### 2. Tab Navigation Not Working
**Problem**: After typing in column search and the debounced search executed, Tab/Shift-Tab wouldn't navigate between matches.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed mode synchronization between widget and buffer
- Added defensive checks to ensure mode stays in ColumnSearch
- Properly handle NextMatch/PreviousMatch actions

### 3. SQL Query Not Restored
**Problem**: After exiting column search with Enter, the original SQL query wasn't restored to the input field.

**Solution**: 
- Clear input_text when exiting column search (Apply or Cancel)
- Ensure last_query is preserved and restored when going back to Command mode
- Added comprehensive logging to track state changes

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
   - Added detailed logging at all critical points
   - Track mode transitions, input_text changes, and last_query preservation
   - Log all matching columns when search executes
   - F5 debug view now shows complete column search state

2. **State Management**
   - Proper separation between `last_query` (executed SQL) and `input_text` (transient text)
   - Clear input_text when exiting search modes
   - Preserve last_query throughout mode transitions

3. **User Experience**
   - Tab/Shift-Tab properly navigate between matching columns
   - Status messages show current match position (e.g., "Column 2/3: parentOrderId")
   - Column search stays active until explicitly exited with Enter or Esc

## Testing Flow

1. Execute a query: `SELECT * FROM table`
2. Press `\` to enter column search mode
3. Type a pattern (e.g., "order")
4. Wait for debounced search (shows matching columns)
5. Use Tab/Shift-Tab to navigate between matches
6. Press Enter to jump to column or Esc to cancel
7. Press `c` to return to Command mode - SQL query is restored

## Files Modified

- `src/enhanced_tui.rs`
  - Removed duplicate key handlers
  - Fixed mode synchronization
  - Added input_text clearing on exit
  - Enhanced debug logging throughout
  
- `src/search_modes_widget.rs`
  - Tab/BackTab handling for ColumnSearch mode
  - Debouncing support

## Debug Helpers

The F5 debug view now shows:
- Current app mode
- Widget state (active/inactive)
- Column search pattern and matches
- Current match index
- Input text vs last_query values
- Complete trace logs with timestamps

This makes it much easier to diagnose issues in the field.
