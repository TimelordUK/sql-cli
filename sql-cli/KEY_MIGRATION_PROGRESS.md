# Key Migration Progress Report
## Branch: key_migration_v3
## Date: 2025-08-21

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete - Simple Toggle Operations

### Successfully Migrated Keys:
- **F12** - Toggle key indicator
- **v** - Toggle selection mode (Cell/Row/Column)  
- **n** - Next search match
- **Shift+N** - Previous search match OR toggle row numbers (context-aware)
- **Shift+S** - Show column statistics
- **Alt+S** - Cycle column packing mode
- **Space** - Toggle viewport lock
- **x/X** - Toggle cursor lock
- **Ctrl+Space** - Toggle viewport lock (alternative)

### Architecture Established:
1. Actions defined in `src/ui/actions.rs`
2. Key mappings in `src/ui/key_mapper.rs`
3. Handlers in `src/ui/enhanced_tui.rs::try_handle_action()`
4. Old handling removed from `handle_results_input()`

## üìã Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Chord Handler Integration
**Status**: Not started
**Keys affected**: 
- `yy` - Yank row
- `yc` - Yank column
- `ya` - Yank all
- `yv` - Yank cell
- `yq` - Yank query

**Challenge**: Chord handler currently intercepts keys before action system

### Phase 4: Remove Dispatcher Layer
**Status**: Not started
**Goal**: Remove intermediate `key_dispatcher` translation layer
**Keys affected**: All keys currently going through dispatcher

### Phase 5: Remaining Results Mode Keys
**Status**: Not started
**Keys to migrate**:
- **Navigation**: 
  - `g/G` - Top/bottom
  - `H/M/L` - Viewport top/middle/bottom
  - `0/$` - First/last column
- **Data Operations**:
  - `f/F` - Filter operations  
  - `/` - Search
  - `?` - Column search
  - `e/E` - Export operations
- **Column Operations**:
  - `p` - Pin column (partially done)
  - `H` - Hide column
  - `</>` or Shift+Left/Right - Move columns
- **Other**:
  - `:` - Jump to row (partially done)
  - `Ctrl+E/J` - Export CSV/JSON
  - `Ctrl+P/N` - History navigation

### Phase 6: Command Mode Keys
**Status**: Not started
**Currently handled by**: EditorWidget and dispatcher
**Keys to migrate**: All Command mode editing keys

### Phase 7: Other Modes
**Status**: Not started
**Modes**: Help, Debug, History, Search, Filter, etc.

## üîç Key Observations

### What's Working Well:
- Action system pattern is clean and extensible
- Centralized action handling reduces coupling
- Key mappings are declarative and easy to understand

### Challenges Found:
1. **Dual-purpose keys**: Some keys have different behaviors based on context (like Shift+N)
2. **Chord handler**: Works outside action system, needs integration strategy
3. **Dispatcher layer**: Still acts as intermediary, should be removed
4. **Mode-specific handling**: Some modes have their own widgets handling keys

### Testing Notes:
- Test all migrated keys in Results mode
- Verify Shift+N toggles row numbers when no search active
- Verify Shift+N navigates search when search is active
- Test viewport/cursor lock operations
- Verify F12 key indicator toggle

## üìÖ Next Session Plan

1. **Merge key_migration_v3 to main** after testing
2. **Start Phase 3**: Integrate chord handler with action system
   - Option A: Make chord handler return Actions instead of strings
   - Option B: Process chords within action system itself
3. **Continue Phase 5**: Migrate remaining Results mode keys in batches
4. **Phase 4**: Remove dispatcher once enough keys are migrated

## üéØ Goal
Complete migration of all key handling to action system to:
- Reduce coupling in TUI main loop
- Enable better testing of key handling
- Make key bindings configurable
- Simplify debugging of key behavior

## üìù Notes for Tomorrow
- Branch `key_migration_v3` is ready for testing and merge
- All Phase 1 keys are working through action system
- Fixed Shift+N dual behavior issue
- Debug trace system also included in this branch (bonus work)
