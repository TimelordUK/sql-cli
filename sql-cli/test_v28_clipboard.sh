echo "What to test:"
echo "============="
echo ""
echo "1. Yank operations (should all go through AppStateContainer now):"
echo "   - Press 'y' → Yank current cell"
echo "   - Press 'Y' → Yank entire row"
echo "   - Press 'Alt+y' → Yank column"
echo "   - Press 'Ctrl+Y' → Yank all data"
echo ""
echo "2. Paste operation:"
echo "   - Press 'Ctrl+V' → Paste from clipboard"
echo "   - Should work in Command mode and Search modes"
echo ""
echo "3. Debug operations (F12 must be on for these):"
echo "   - Press 'Ctrl+T' → Yank as test case"
echo "   - Press 'Shift+Y' → Yank debug context"
echo ""
echo "4. F5 Debug Mode:"
echo "   - Press 'F5' → Should copy debug info to clipboard automatically"
echo ""
echo "5. Check logs for proper AppStateContainer usage:"
echo "   - Look for 'Clipboard' entries in debug logs"
echo "   - Should see yank operations tracked in state"
echo ""

echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "=================="
echo "- All clipboard operations should work as before"
echo "- F5 should show clipboard stats in debug info"
echo "- No 'arboard::Clipboard' direct usage in enhanced_tui"
echo "- All operations go through AppStateContainer methods"

echo "Run with:"

echo "Enable debug logging with:"
