# SQL-CLI Refactoring Progress & Next Steps

## Date: 2025-01-14
After 13-hour session - Major architectural improvements completed

## ‚úÖ Completed Today

### 1. DataView as Single Source of Truth
- **Pinned Columns**: Fully implemented in DataView with proper boundaries
  - Columns stay on left when scrolling
  - Navigation respects pinned boundaries (can't cursor into pinned area)
  - Cursor follows columns when moving, even with pinned columns
  - ASCII [P] indicator for better compatibility

### 2. Sorting System Overhaul  
- **3-State Sorting**: Clean implementation (Ascending ‚Üí Descending ‚Üí None)
  - Sort state tracked in DataView, not scattered across TUI
  - `toggle_sort()` method for proper cycling
  - Visual indicators (‚Üë ‚Üì) in status messages
  - Works like Excel - repeated presses cycle through states

### 3. ViewportManager Foundation
- Created abstraction layer between DataView and rendering
- Manages visible window, column widths, caching
- Architecture: DataTable ‚Üí DataView ‚Üí ViewportManager ‚Üí Renderer
- Added to F5 debug output

### 4. Memory Optimization Continued
- Further reduction: 700MB ‚Üí 335MB (52% reduction)
- Removed cloned data from Buffer
- Using indices instead of data copies

## üìã Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### Phase 1: Extract Key Management (CRITICAL - Do First!)
```rust
// Move out of enhanced_tui.rs into dedicated modules:
- key_manager/mod.rs
  - chord_detector.rs  // Chord detection logic
  - key_recorder.rs    // Recording/playback
  - key_dispatcher.rs  // Route keys to handlers
  - key_bindings.rs    // Configurable bindings
```

**Why First**: This is the biggest remaining mess in the TUI. Once extracted:
- Redux actions can be dispatched from clean key handlers
- TUI becomes purely a view layer
- Testing becomes much easier
- Can add configurable keybindings

### Phase 2: Fix Filtering (After Keys)
- Move filter state into DataView (like we did with sorting)
- Implement filter cycling/toggling
- Track case sensitivity in DataView
- Make filter state part of DataView's internal state

### Phase 3: Final TUI Audit
- Check for remaining hacks/anti-patterns
- Look for any remaining direct state mutations
- Identify what can move to ViewportManager
- Document remaining technical debt

### Phase 4: Begin Redux Implementation
With clean key handling, we can:
- Create central store
- Define action types
- Implement reducers
- Convert all state changes to dispatched actions

## üöÄ Future Optimization Ideas

### Query Parallelization
1. **GPU Acceleration (CUDA)**
   - Offload simple branches to GPU cores
   - Parallel filtering on large datasets
   - Aggregate computations (SUM, AVG, etc.)
   
2. **Rust Parallel Queries (like C# PLINQ)**
   ```rust
   // Use rayon for parallel iteration
   use rayon::prelude::*;
   
   // Query optimizer could split work:
   let (left_branch, right_branch) = query.split_at_optimization_point();
   let (left_result, right_result) = rayon::join(
       || execute_branch(left_branch),
       || execute_branch(right_branch)
   );
   ```

3. **Multi-threaded Query Execution**
   - Identify independent branches in query tree
   - Execute branches on different threads
   - Merge results efficiently
   - Consider using tokio for async execution

### Architecture Vision
```
Query Parser
    ‚Üì
Query Optimizer (identifies parallelizable branches)
    ‚Üì
Execution Planner
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CPU Branch (complex logic)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GPU Branch (simple parallel ops)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Thread Pool Branch (independent subqueries)
    ‚Üì
Result Merger
    ‚Üì
DataView
```

## üîß Technical Debt Remaining

1. **In enhanced_tui.rs**:
   - Key handling logic (tomorrow's priority)
   - Some direct buffer mutations
   - Mixed concerns (UI + business logic)

2. **In DataView**:
   - Case sensitivity not tracked for filters
   - Could optimize visible_rows updates

3. **In ViewportManager**:
   - Column width calculation could be smarter
   - Need better caching strategy

## üìù Notes for Tomorrow

1. Start with key extraction - it's the biggest win
2. Keep changes incremental and testable  
3. After key extraction, the Redux implementation should be straightforward
4. Consider creating a `state/` module structure for Redux:
   ```
   state/
     store.rs
     actions.rs
     reducers/
       data_reducer.rs
       ui_reducer.rs
       navigation_reducer.rs
   ```

## üí° Key Insights from Today

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Having DataView own its state (sort, filter, pinned) makes everything cleaner
2. **Abstraction Layers**: ViewportManager proves the value of proper separation of concerns
3. **Incremental Refactoring**: Each improvement makes the next one easier
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Using indices instead of cloning data has massive impact

*Remember: The goal is to make the TUI a pure view layer that simply renders state and dispatches actions. We're getting close!*
