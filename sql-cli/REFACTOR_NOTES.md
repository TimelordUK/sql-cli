# SQL-CLI Refactoring Progress & Next Steps

## Date: 2025-01-14
After 13-hour session - Major architectural improvements completed

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. DataView as Single Source of Truth
- **Pinned Columns**: Fully implemented in DataView with proper boundaries
  - Columns stay on left when scrolling
  - Navigation respects pinned boundaries (can't cursor into pinned area)
  - Cursor follows columns when moving, even with pinned columns
  - ASCII [P] indicator for better compatibility

### 2. Sorting System Overhaul  
- **3-State Sorting**: Clean implementation (Ascending → Descending → None)
  - Sort state tracked in DataView, not scattered across TUI
  - `toggle_sort()` method for proper cycling
  - Visual indicators (↑ ↓) in status messages
  - Works like Excel - repeated presses cycle through states

### 3. ViewportManager Foundation
- Created abstraction layer between DataView and rendering
- Manages visible window, column widths, caching
- Architecture: DataTable → DataView → ViewportManager → Renderer
- Added to F5 debug output

### 4. Memory Optimization Continued
- Further reduction: 700MB → 335MB (52% reduction)
- Removed cloned data from Buffer
- Using indices instead of data copies

## 📋 Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### Phase 1: Extract Key Management (CRITICAL - Do First!)
```rust
// Move out of enhanced_tui.rs into dedicated modules:
- key_manager/mod.rs
  - chord_detector.rs  // Chord detection logic
  - key_recorder.rs    // Recording/playback
  - key_dispatcher.rs  // Route keys to handlers
  - key_bindings.rs    // Configurable bindings
```

**Why First**: This is the biggest remaining mess in the TUI. Once extracted:
- Redux actions can be dispatched from clean key handlers
- TUI becomes purely a view layer
- Testing becomes much easier
- Can add configurable keybindings

### Phase 2: Fix Filtering (After Keys)
- Move filter state into DataView (like we did with sorting)
- Implement filter cycling/toggling
- Track case sensitivity in DataView
- Make filter state part of DataView's internal state

### Phase 3: Final TUI Audit
- Check for remaining hacks/anti-patterns
- Look for any remaining direct state mutations
- Identify what can move to ViewportManager
- Document remaining technical debt

### Phase 4: Begin Redux Implementation
With clean key handling, we can:
- Create central store
- Define action types
- Implement reducers
- Convert all state changes to dispatched actions

## 🚀 Future Optimization Ideas

### Query Parallelization
1. **GPU Acceleration (CUDA)**
   - Offload simple branches to GPU cores
   - Parallel filtering on large datasets
   - Aggregate computations (SUM, AVG, etc.)
   
2. **Rust Parallel Queries (like C# PLINQ)**
   ```rust
   // Use rayon for parallel iteration
   use rayon::prelude::*;
   
   // Query optimizer could split work:
   let (left_branch, right_branch) = query.split_at_optimization_point();
   let (left_result, right_result) = rayon::join(
       || execute_branch(left_branch),
       || execute_branch(right_branch)
   );
   ```

3. **Multi-threaded Query Execution**
   - Identify independent branches in query tree
   - Execute branches on different threads
   - Merge results efficiently
   - Consider using tokio for async execution

### Architecture Vision
```
Query Parser
    ↓
Query Optimizer (identifies parallelizable branches)
    ↓
Execution Planner
    ├── CPU Branch (complex logic)
    ├── GPU Branch (simple parallel ops)
    └── Thread Pool Branch (independent subqueries)
    ↓
Result Merger
    ↓
DataView
```

## 🔧 Technical Debt Remaining

1. **In enhanced_tui.rs**:
   - Key handling logic (tomorrow's priority)
   - Some direct buffer mutations
   - Mixed concerns (UI + business logic)
   - **Code duplication**: `new_with_csv()` and `new_with_json()` are nearly identical

2. **In DataView**:
   - Case sensitivity not tracked for filters
   - Could optimize visible_rows updates

3. **In ViewportManager**:
   - Column width calculation could be smarter
   - Need better caching strategy

## 📝 Notes for Tomorrow

1. Start with key extraction - it's the biggest win
2. Keep changes incremental and testable  
3. After key extraction, the Redux implementation should be straightforward
4. Consider creating a `state/` module structure for Redux:
   ```
   state/
     store.rs
     actions.rs
     reducers/
       data_reducer.rs
       ui_reducer.rs
       navigation_reducer.rs
   ```

## 🔨 Quick Refactors to Consider

### Combine new_with_csv and new_with_json
```rust
enum FileType {
    Csv,
    Json,
}

pub fn new_with_file(file_path: &str, file_type: FileType) -> Result<Self> {
    // Common logic for both CSV and JSON
    let datatable = match file_type {
        FileType::Csv => load_csv_to_datatable(file_path, &table_name)?,
        FileType::Json => load_json_to_datatable(file_path, &table_name)?,
    };
    // Rest is identical...
}

// Then:
pub fn new_with_csv(csv_path: &str) -> Result<Self> {
    Self::new_with_file(csv_path, FileType::Csv)
}

pub fn new_with_json(json_path: &str) -> Result<Self> {
    Self::new_with_file(json_path, FileType::Json)
}
```

## 💡 Key Insights from Today

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Having DataView own its state (sort, filter, pinned) makes everything cleaner
2. **Abstraction Layers**: ViewportManager proves the value of proper separation of concerns
3. **Incremental Refactoring**: Each improvement makes the next one easier
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Using indices instead of cloning data has massive impact
5. **Code Duplication**: Even in refactored code, we still find duplication (CSV/JSON loaders)

*Remember: The goal is to make the TUI a pure view layer that simply renders state and dispatches actions. We're getting close!*
