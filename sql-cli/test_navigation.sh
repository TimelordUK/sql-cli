echo "New keyboard shortcuts for cursor navigation:"
echo "  Ctrl+A - Jump to beginning of line (like bash/zsh)"
echo "  Ctrl+E - Jump to end of line (like bash/zsh)"

echo "These shortcuts work in Command Mode and make it easy to navigate"
echo "long SQL queries without having to hold arrow keys."
echo ""
echo "Example workflow:"
echo "1. Load a long query from history with Ctrl+R"
echo "2. Press Ctrl+E to jump to the end to add more conditions"
echo "3. Press Ctrl+A to jump to the beginning to modify SELECT columns"
echo ""
echo "The input now uses horizontal scrolling for long queries,"
echo "so the cursor will always be visible within the terminal width."
