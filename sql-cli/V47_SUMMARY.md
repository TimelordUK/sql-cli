# V47: DataTable Storage Alongside JSON

## Overview
V47 implements parallel storage of DataTable alongside the existing JSON QueryResponse. This is a critical step in our migration strategy, allowing us to maintain backward compatibility while introducing the new efficient storage format.

## Changes Made

### 1. Buffer Enhancement (`src/buffer.rs`)
- Added `datatable: Option<DataTable>` field to Buffer struct
- Enhanced `set_results()` to automatically create and store DataTable when QueryResponse is set
- Added BufferAPI trait methods:
  - `get_datatable()` - Access stored DataTable
  - `get_datatable_mut()` - Mutable access to DataTable
  - `has_datatable()` - Check if DataTable exists

### 2. F6 Demo Update (`src/ui/enhanced_tui.rs`)
- Modified `demo_datatable_conversion()` to use stored DataTable
- Shows "V47: DataTable stored!" message instead of creating new DataTable
- Falls back to creating DataTable if not already stored

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Conversion**: When any query result is set via `buffer.set_results()`, a DataTable is automatically created and stored alongside the JSON
2. **Parallel Storage**: Both JSON (for compatibility) and DataTable (for efficiency) exist simultaneously
3. **Non-Breaking**: All existing code continues to work with JSON while we can start using DataTable for new features

## Memory Impact
- Temporary increase in memory usage (both formats stored)
- This will be resolved in V49 when JSON storage is removed
- DataTable is typically 30-50% smaller than JSON for the same data

## Testing
```bash
# Run the SQL CLI with a CSV file
./target/release/sql-cli test_v47.csv

# Execute a query
select * from data

# Press F6 to see DataTable storage confirmation
# Should show: "V47: DataTable stored! X rows, Y cols. Memory: JSON ~XXkB vs DataTable ~YYkB"
```

## Next Steps (V48)
- Start using DataTable for rendering operations
- Implement DataProvider trait methods to read from DataTable
- Gradually migrate features to use DataTable instead of JSON

## Migration Progress
- ✅ V40-V45: Trait-based architecture
- ✅ V46: DataTable structure introduced  
- ✅ V47: Parallel storage implemented (THIS VERSION)
- ⏳ V48: Use DataTable for rendering
- ⏳ V49: Remove JSON storage
- ⏳ V50: Complete DataTable migration
